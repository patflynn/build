# Claude Code Rules for Basement Lab

## Git & GitHub

- **Never reference Claude in commits or PRs.** Do not include "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any mention of Claude/AI in commit messages, PR titles, or PR descriptions.
- **All changes must be submitted as pull requests.** Never push directly to the main branch. Always create a feature branch and open a PR for review.
