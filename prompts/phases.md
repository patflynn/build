# Schema Constraints

**CRITICAL: These constraints must be followed in all generated programs:**

1. **One exercise per entry.** Never combine multiple movements in a single exercise entry (e.g., "Pullups & Dips" is invalid). Each movement gets its own entry with its own sets, reps, and video link. This enables proper tracking and clear instruction.

# Phase 1: The Foundation (Months 1-3)
"Act as a strength coach specializing in sarcopenia prevention and aesthetics for men over 45. Create a 12-week 'Recomposition' program for a male, 47, with mild back history.
Equipment: Kettlebells, Swedish Ladder, Pull-up Bar, Peloton.
Goal: Fix posture, build core stability, and establish neuromuscular connection.
Format: Output valid JSON matching the 'Basement Lab' schema.
Schedule: 3 days Strength (Full Body), 2 days Conditioning (Peloton/Carries). Focus on tempo and form over heavy weight."

# Phase 2: Hypertrophy & Shape (Months 4-7)
"Update the program for the 'Hypertrophy' phase. The user has now added Adjustable Dumbbells (5-50lbs), a Bench, and TRX.
Goal: Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy (muscle size) and 'V-taper' development (Back/Shoulders).
Constraint: The user has mild ADD; vary the accessory movements every 4 weeks to maintain engagement.
Format: JSON.
Schedule: 4-day Upper/Lower split. Include supersets to increase density."

# Phase 3: The "Reveal" & Cut (Months 8-12)
"Update the program for the final 'Cutting' phase.
Goal: Maximize caloric burn while maintaining muscle mass to get 'ripped' (10-12% body fat).
Technique: Use 'Peripheral Heart Action' (alternating upper/lower exercises) to keep heart rate high.
Format: JSON.
Schedule: 3 days Full Body Metabolic Resistance Training + 2 days High-Intensity Intervals on Peloton."
